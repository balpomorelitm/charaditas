# Charaditas

Charaditas is a lightweight word guessing game, similar to charades, built
with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The host displays a word on the screen
and the other players try to guess it before time runs out.

You can play it online at
[https://charaditas.pablotorrado.site](https://charaditas.pablotorrado.site).

## How to run

Serve the project with any static HTTP server so that `words.json` can be loaded correctly. For example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
